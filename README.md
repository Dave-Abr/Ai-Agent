# PDF Chat and FAQs

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content. It uses the OpenAI API to answer both general questions and FAQs based on the content of the provided PDF.

## Features
- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload a PDF file, and the system automatically extracts the text from all its pages.
- **Interactive Chat:** Chat interface where users can ask questions in Spanish about the uploaded PDF.
- **Intelligent Answers:** The assistant uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to respond, using the PDF content as context if available.
- **Conversation History:** Maintains the message history for a smooth conversational experience.
